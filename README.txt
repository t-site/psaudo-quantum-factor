psaudo-quantum-factor

-------------------------

qfactor command
compute prime factorial of 1st argument.

random search instead incremental search.

this is my "psaudo-quantum" series.
but this not so faster than quantum-computers.
it is just slower than GNU coreutil's factor.

qfactor-mp.c requires GNU GMP library.

the THRESH macro change to large value for much faster.

IN FACT...

GNU coreutil's factor programm is much "psaudo-quantum computing" inplement.
its Pollard-Brent rho algorithm requires random numbers.
simply it use the birthday paradox in many times.
dont miss you the fact. 
digital computers are much faster than it.

BUG

Always display answers in same time.
I didnt use display buffer. I programmed do it time to time.
